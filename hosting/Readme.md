Very ad-hoc instructions on how to host a nix hour

- In YouTube, schedule a stream with:
  - Select stream key: 1440p30 Test 2 (RTMP, 1440p)
  - Copy the generated stream key
- Open OBS, switch to my own scene
  - Enter the stream key in the settings
- Run ./script.sh, follow instructions, which does automatically:
  - Turn notifications off
  - Open jitsi on the left screen in full screen
  - Ensure that xmobar doesn't crash
  - Stop the backup service, don't want it to use up all the bandwidth
- Clear the workspaces on the main monitor
- Turn off the speaker
  - Otherwise there's a hum in the background
- In jitsi:
  - Make sure the scale is at 130%
  - Make sure to press F11 for fullscreen
  - Enable audio, webcam and full screen sharing
  - Go to the "You are sharing your screen" view
  - Open chat
- Start the stream with Ctrl-Shift-S
- When somebody else is sharing their screen, switch to the other scene using the keyboard button and optionally hide the chat
- Stop the stream with Ctrl-Shift-S
