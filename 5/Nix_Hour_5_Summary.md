### Summary
- **Time Interval:** 00:00:02 - 00:57:28
- Addresses the process of overriding Rust packages in Nix, focusing on updating the 'airshipper' package from version 0.7 to 0.9.
- Challenges in updating the `cargoSha256` hash for Rust package overrides in Nix.
- Demonstrates creating a Nix overlay to override the package, with modifications to the `src` attribute and hash.
- In-depth discussion on fetching and updating the source of a Rust package from GitHub.
- Explains the use of `fetchFromGitHub` and `fetchTarball` in Nix and their different hash handling.
- Troubleshooting common errors encountered in Rust package overrides in Nix.
- Delves into Nix internals, explaining derivation attributes like `outputHash`.
- Covers advanced Nix topics such as closure inspection, derivation attributes, and the impact of derivation names.
- Practical demonstration of using Nix REPL for inspecting and manipulating derivations.
- Discusses Nix concepts like strict evaluation, runtime dependencies, and garbage collection in relation to derivations.
